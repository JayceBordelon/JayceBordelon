### about me

software engineer at **mastercard** by day, building **[occupai](https://occupai.us)** the rest of the time.

i like working across the stack — whether that's writing backend services, messing with infrastructure, or building out frontends. lately i've been spending a lot of time on computer vision and figuring out how to make AI actually useful in the real world.

mostly just trying to learn as much as i can and build things that matter.

### what i work with

**languages** · java, python, typescript, go, ruby, c++

**frameworks** · spring boot, next.js, react, fastapi, rails, node

**infra** · aws, docker, kubernetes, linux, github actions

**data** · postgres, mongodb, redis, graphql

### current project: occupai

working on **[occupai](https://occupai.us)** — a platform that uses computer vision to help restaurants and bars catch revenue leaks in real-time.

- full-stack app built with next.js, docker swarm, and SSE for live updates
- building AI agents for venue insights and inventory tracking
- took 2nd place at STL startup week (pretty stoked about that one)
